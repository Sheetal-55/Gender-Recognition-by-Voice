This database is created to identify a voice as male or female, based upon acoustic properties of the voice and speech. 
The dataset consists of 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers.
The voice samples are already pre-processed with an analyzed frequency range of 0hz-280hz (human vocal range).
